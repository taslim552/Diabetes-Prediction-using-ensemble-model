Sure! Here are **two realistic sample inputs** (not from the PIMA dataset) with all 8 features used in your app, designed to test both diabetic and non-diabetic scenarios. You can enter them manually in your Streamlit UI or test them via code.

### ðŸ”¹ **Sample Input 1: Likely Non-Diabetic**
| Feature                      | Value  |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Pregnancies                 | 1      |
| Glucose                     | 95     |
| Blood Pressure              | 72     |
| Skin Thickness              | 23     |
| Insulin                     | 88     |
| BMI                         | 24.3   |
| Diabetes Pedigree Function  | 0.127  |
| Age                         | 29     |

Would you like code to test these programmatically or want me to generate more diverse edge cases (e.g. low insulin, young age, high BMI)?
